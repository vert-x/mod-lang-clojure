(ns vertx.http.sockjs
  "This is an implementation of the server side part of https://github.com/sockjs
  <p>SockJS enables browsers to communicate with the server using a simple WebSocket-like api for sending
  and receiving messages. Under the bonnet SockJS chooses to use one of several protocols depending on browser
  capabilities and what appears to be working across the network.<p>
  Available protocols include:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>WebSockets</li>
    <li>xhr-polling</li>
    <li>xhr-streaming</li>
    <li>json-polling</li>
    <li>event-source</li>
    <li>html-file</li>
  </ul><p>
  This means, it should <i>just work</i> irrespective of what browser is being used, and whether there are nasty
  things like proxies and load balancers between the client and the server.<p>

  For more detailed information on SockJS, see their website.<p>

  On the server side, you interact using instances of {@link SockJSSocket} - this allows you to send data to the
  client or receive data via the {@link SockJSSocket#dataHandler}.<p>

  You can register multiple applications with the same SockJSServer, each using different path prefixes, each
  application will have its own handler, and configuration.<p>

  Instances of this class are not thread-safe.<p>"
