   A Pump pumps data from a ReadStream to a WriteStream and performs
   flow control where necessary to prevent the write stream buffer
   from getting overfull.

   Read bytes from a ReadStream and writes them to a WriteStream. If
   data can be read faster than it can be written this could result in
   the write queue of the WriteStream growing without bound,
   eventually causing it to exhaust all available RAM.

   To prevent this, after each write, it checks whether the write
   queue of the WriteStream is full, and if so, the ReadStream is
   paused, and a drainHandler is set on the WriteStream. When the
   WriteStream has processed half of its backlog, the
   drainHandler will be called, which results in the pump resuming
   the ReadStream.
